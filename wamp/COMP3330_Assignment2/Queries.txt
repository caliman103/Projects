CHANGES FOR WRITEUP
-	Changed the studentID's from starting at 1000 to starting 1 one 

-	Changed how informaiton is displayed on StudentInformation.php. Concatanated the ParentEmail and
	parentPhoneNumer into Parent Information (separated by a comma).
	

-	When adding a record users must enter all student information. No nulls allowed.


-	Parent phone number must start with 1 246-

-	Changed length of parent email to 50 since 20 was too small and some emails were being cut off



Innovations
AddStudent.php
-	Users can hover over question mark to see the format required for each input field

-


SearchStudent.php
-	Most of the information the user will enter will come from a dropdown box which reduces the chances of errors occuring on
	of the user. There is also a regular expression on the only input fields which further decreases the chance of a feiled
	seacrch being performed as a resukt of the data being entered.

-	The user does not need to enter any informaiton and the search still works. In this case all students will be returned


-	After the serach has been performed there will be a link to the edit page for each student provided so the user can
	edit one of the students they searched for straight after the search was performed.
