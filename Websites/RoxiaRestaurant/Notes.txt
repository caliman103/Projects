Races
    - Ambroxians
        - Maximum energy = 25 (Exceding this results in "death by greed")
        - They hate all multiples of 6. If they get a seating allocation of 6 
          they become enraged and this rage is contagious
        - They eat zoro, scron and ambron, if they eat elixon their energy level
          reaches full capacity
        
    - Scoraxians
        - Maximum energy = 20 (Exceding this results in "death by greed")
        - They find Zoraxiams weak
        - Eat scoron and ambron, they have "death by alergic reaction" if they eat
          zoron. Eating elixon depleted their energy
    
    - Zoraxians
        - Maximum energy = 15 (Exceding this results in "death by greed")
        - Become weak and defenceless if energy level is below 3
        - Eat zoronn and ambron, if they eat scoron they only get half the value
        - If they eat any amount of elixon, it increases their energy level by 25%
        - They hunt Ambroxians and hunt in pairs
        - An Ambroxian should not be seated with a Zoraxian to the front and back
          or left and right.
